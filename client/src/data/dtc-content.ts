  {
    id: "what-is-bph",
    question: "What is BPH and how do I know if I have it?",
    answer: "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that affects about 50% of men by age 50. Common symptoms include frequent urination (especially at night), weak urine stream, difficulty starting urination, feeling like you can't completely empty your bladder, and sudden urges to urinate.",
    category: "general"
  },
  {
    id: "how-common-bph",
    question: "How common is BPH?",
    answer: "BPH is extremely common - affecting about 40 million men in the US alone. By age 80, up to 90% of men experience BPH symptoms. Many men think these symptoms are just a normal part of aging, but effective treatments are available.",
    category: "general"
  },
  {
    id: "spring-system-explained",
    question: "How does the Spring System work?",
    answer: "The Spring System uses a small, permanent implant that is placed in the prostate through the urethra (no incisions needed). The spring gently props open the compressed urethra, allowing urine to flow freely again - like opening a door that was stuck shut.",
    category: "procedure"
  },
  {
    id: "procedure-duration",
    question: "How long does the Spring System procedure take?",
    answer: "The procedure typically takes 15-30 minutes and is performed as an outpatient procedure. You'll go home the same day with minimal discomfort.",
    category: "procedure"
  },
  {
    id: "recovery-time",
    question: "What is the recovery like?",
    answer: "Most patients return to normal activities within 2-3 days. You may experience some temporary mild discomfort or blood in urine for the first few days, but this typically resolves quickly. Unlike some other procedures, there's usually no need for a catheter.",
    category: "recovery"
  },
  {
    id: "sexual-function-impact",
    question: "Will the Spring System affect my sexual function?",
    answer: "Clinical studies show no negative impact on erectile or ejaculatory function. In fact, some patients report improved sexual satisfaction due to reduced anxiety about urinary symptoms. This is a key advantage over some medications and surgical procedures.",
    category: "benefits"
  },
  {
    id: "results-timeline",
    question: "When will I see results?",
    answer: "Most patients notice significant improvement in their symptoms within 2-4 weeks after the procedure. The full benefits typically develop over the first few months as any initial swelling resolves.",
    category: "benefits"
  },
  {
    id: "durability",
    question: "How long do the results last?",
    answer: "Clinical studies show durable symptom improvement lasting 3+ years and counting. The Spring System is designed to be a long-term solution, not a temporary fix.",
    category: "benefits"
  },
  {
    id: "vs-medications",
    question: "Can I stop taking BPH medications after the procedure?",
    answer: "Many patients are able to reduce or eliminate their BPH medications after the Spring System procedure, but this decision should always be made in consultation with your urologist based on your individual response to treatment.",
    category: "benefits"
  },
  {
    id: "candidate-eligibility",
    question: "Am I a candidate for the Spring System?",
    answer: "The Spring System is appropriate for many men with BPH symptoms, but the best way to determine if you're a candidate is to consult with a urologist who is trained in the procedure. Factors like prostate size, overall health, and symptom severity all play a role in treatment selection.",
